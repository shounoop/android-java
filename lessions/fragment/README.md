# FRAGMENT

### Fragment in Android

### Static and Dynamic Fragment

### Fragment from Backstack

- Both _popBackStack()_ and _popBackStack(name, flag)_ are methods of the FragmentManager class used to manipulate the back stack of fragments.

  - popBackStack(): This method is used to pop the topmost fragment from the back stack. If the back stack is empty, it does nothing. If the topmost fragment has a transition animation, it will be played in reverse. This method does not take any arguments.

  - popBackStack(name, flag): This method is used to pop one or more fragments from the back stack based on the name and flag arguments. The name argument is a string that represents the name of the fragment or the starting point of the pop operation. The flag argument specifies the behavior of the pop operation. There are two possible values for the flag argument:

    - 0: This flag means that the pop operation should be performed up to and including the named fragment.

    - FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE: This flag means that the pop operation should be performed up to but not including the named fragment.

    If the name argument is null, then all fragments up to and including the topmost fragment will be popped.

  In summary, popBackStack() is used to pop the topmost fragment from the back stack, while popBackStack(name, flag) is used to pop one or more fragments from the back stack based on the name and flag arguments.
